### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

My name is Tao Xin. I created **VanJS** (https://vanjs.org, [repo](https://github.com/vanjs-org/van)) in 2023, which is the smallest reactive UI framework in the world. I think **VanJS** is super cool! With only 0.8kB in `.min.js.gz` and 1.3kB in `.min.js`, **VanJS** offers a programming experience similar to (if not better than) React. If you're interested in **VanJS**, please consider starring the project. It takes just a few seconds but your support means the world to me and helps spread **VanJS** to a wider audience. Meanwhile, feel free to leave your comments in [Discussions](https://github.com/vanjs-org/van/discussions).

### ðŸ’¡ Fun facts 

- **VanJS** stands for abbreviated **Van**illa **J**ava**S**cript. The design philosophy of **VanJS** is to stay as close to Vanilla JavaScript as possible. As explain in details [here](https://vanjs.org/about#name), **VanJS** provides a way to write abbreviated/sugared form of Vanilla JavaScript code.
- The "Why VanJS" section of https://vanjs.org home page is indeed 40% larger than the entire VanJS framework itself (1882 bytes vs 1333 bytes).
- Despite **VanJS** being a front end framework, I do backend engineering for a living.
- List of my favoriate programming languages (ranked by fondness, not by familiarity):
  1. Zig
  2. Rust
  3. Kotlin
  4. JavaScript
  5. TypeScript
  6. C++
  7. *A lot of others*
